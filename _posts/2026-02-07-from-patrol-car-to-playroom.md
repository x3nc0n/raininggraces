If you had told me years ago that my path would lead from the Oklahoma City Police Department to the heart of birth work, I might have laughed. Yet looking back, every chapter of my life has been preparing me—quietly, purposefully—for the work I do today as a doula.

My story isn’t a straight line. It’s a braid of service, motherhood, and calling. And each strand has shaped the calm, capable, nurturing support I now offer to families.

## The Officer: Learning to Stand Steady in the Storm

When I joined the Oklahoma City Police Department, I stepped into a world where every day demanded clarity, courage, and compassion. I learned how to stay grounded when emotions ran high, how to communicate with purpose, and how to advocate fiercely for the people in front of me.

Those years taught me:

- How to remain calm when others feel overwhelmed
- How to assess a situation quickly and respond with confidence
- How to listen beneath the surface
- How to protect the dignity and safety of every person I encountered

I didn’t know it then, but these skills would become the backbone of my doula work.

## The Stay‑at‑Home Mom: Rediscovering Presence, Patience, and Tenderness

Leaving law enforcement to raise my children was a shift from adrenaline to intimacy. Suddenly my days were filled with tiny hands, big emotions, and the sacred work of nurturing life from the inside out.

Motherhood softened me in all the right ways. It taught me:

- The power of quiet presence
- The beauty of slowing down
- The importance of meeting people—especially little ones—exactly where they are
- The deep intuition that comes from caring for your own babies

In those years at home, I learned how to hold space with gentleness, how to comfort without words, and how to trust the natural rhythms of family life. Those lessons now flow directly into the way I support birthing families.

## The Doula: Where Strength and Softness Meet

When God nudged me toward birth work, I realized something profound: every part of my story had been preparing me for this.

As a doula, I bring the steadiness of an officer and the tenderness of a mother into every birth space. Families feel it the moment I walk in—the blend of grounded confidence and nurturing warmth.

My background allows me to offer:

- Calm guidance during intense moments
- Clear communication when decisions feel overwhelming
- Emotional steadiness that helps families feel safe
- A nurturing presence that honors the sacredness of birth
- Advocacy rooted in respect, dignity, and compassion

Birth is unpredictable, but my clients know they have someone beside them who can handle intensity with grace and gentleness.

## A Calling Woven Through Every Chapter

I didn’t leave my past behind when I became a doula. I brought it with me—every lesson, every moment of growth, every skill shaped by service and motherhood.

Today, I support families with a heart that has been strengthened by challenge, softened by love, and guided by faith. My journey from officer to stay‑at‑home mom to doula isn’t a detour. It’s a preparation.

And it’s my greatest honor to walk with families as they welcome new life, offering the calm, capable, nurturing support that has been years in the making.
