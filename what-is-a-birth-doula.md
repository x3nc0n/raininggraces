|
 As your birth doula, my role is to walk alongside you through the entire journey of pregnancy, birth, and the early postpartum days. Before labor begins, we’ll meet for prenatal visits where I’ll get to know your hopes, concerns, and preferences for a birth plan. Together, we’ll explore personalized coping skills, relaxation techniques, and comfort measures so you feel prepared and confident. I’ll also help you and your partner practice hands‑on techniques, giving you both practical ways to ease discomfort and encourage progress when the big day arrives.

 During labor, I’ll be a steady presence—offering encouragement, guiding you through breathing and relaxation, and providing physical support when needed. My goal is to help you feel safe, supported, and empowered, while also helping your partner engage meaningfully in the process. After your baby arrives, I’ll visit again to check in, answer questions, and help you process your birth experience. Whether it’s offering resources, emotional support, or simply listening, I’m here to ensure you feel cared for every step of the way.
