# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: |
  My name is Robin Spaid, and I am a dedicated birth doula and lifelong resident of Oklahoma City. My husband, John, and I have been married for 20 years, and together we’ve been blessed with six beautiful children and three precious angels in Heaven. Motherhood has shaped every part of who I am, and it’s the foundation of the intuition, empathy, and steady presence I bring to the families I serve. Before becoming a doula, I spent seven years serving our community with the Oklahoma City Police Department before transitioning into full-time motherhood.

  In 2024, I felt God calling me into birth work—to walk alongside women with compassion, encouragement, and a deep respect for the sacredness of pregnancy and birth. Answering that call has been one of the greatest gifts of my life. I provide comprehensive physical, emotional, and spiritual support throughout pregnancy and birth, offering evidence-based information, practical tools, and unwavering reassurance. My training includes extensive study, hands-on shadowing with an experienced local doula, participation in a mentorship program, and becoming the OKC Metro’s premiere Spinning Babies® Certified Parent Educator. My goal is to empower every woman to recognize her immense strength and God-given potential. It is an honor to support families as they welcome new life, and I approach each birth with compassion, respect, and a sense of sacred purpose.
