*I can NOT say enough about Robin and what she did for me!!! I had been on the fence for a long time about going natural. We met for the first time and I had several questions for her and my husband did as well. She was so patient and attentive and had no problem answering all of our questions. After meeting with her, I finalized my decision and knew that I could go natural with her helping me. When she arrived to my hospital room, we got to work! Her calm and encouraging personality made all the difference!! She has also been so supportive postpartum! I’m more than confident that I can go natural again and I wouldn’t recommend anyone else to do it with!!!*
