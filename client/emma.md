*Robin was a wonderful asset to have leading up to and during labor! She was very knowledgeable and quick to respond to any questions we had. During labor she helped maintain a calm and peaceful atmosphere with encouragement and suggestions to help make the process as comfortable as possible. I would highly recommend her to ladies who are looking for a passionate, kind, and supportive doula!*
