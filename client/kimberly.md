*Robin was absolutely wonderful! My husband and I enjoyed a private Spinning Babies class with Robin in the comfort of our own home. I would recommend this experience as a necessity for anyone who is pregnant. You’ll want and need this information and these skills in your toolbox when it’s time for labor and delivery. The knowledge and confidence we gained from this class with Robin was immediately helpful. The exercises we learned helped alleviate the daily discomforts I was currently experiencing during pregnancy. The Spinning Babies techniques for labor are rooted in natural physiological principles; however, this is my third pregnancy but the first time I’ve been educated on these simple and straightforward techniques to aid and assist in my own labor and delivery. We wish we had taken this class with Robin years ago!*
