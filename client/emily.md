*I was blessed to have Robin as one of my doulas for the journey of my second baby. She helped me process my first birth and mentally prepare for my second. When I went into labor, she joined me at my house and helped advise when it was quickly time to go to the hospital. Throughout she was calm and a guiding light. She helped me navigate holding on to the birthing bars on the back of the bed in labor and delivery and she held my head to help comfort me as I delivered my son. Wow what a wonderful experience! Robin is a true blessing as she helped instill confidence and peacefulness in the entire process for my family.*
