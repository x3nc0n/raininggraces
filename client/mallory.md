*My husband and I used Robin’s doula services and also took her Spinning Babies class and both were amazing!! As first time parents, we were nervous about birth and all of the unknown but Robin brought us so much peace and clarity as we navigated pregnancy, birth and postpartum. Her spinning babies class helped to prepare my body for birth and also were utilized during labor! All of her recommendations and tips were taken advantage of and we absolutely loved having her as part of our birth story. I ended up having a medically necessary c section which Robin also walked us through and helped us navigate despite that being far different than my birth “preferences”. We loved loved loved having Robin with us*
