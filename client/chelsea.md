*Robin lead a private Spinning Babies class for us recently, and it was wonderful. I am now equipped with daily activities to do to help prepare for labor, and my husband was able to learn support techniques to help me prepare before and during labor. The spinning babies material was provided in a way that was easy to understand with ample time to physically complete each of the activities and positions. We are so grateful that Robin took the time to help us prepare, and we feel more confident after completing the class. Thank you Robin!*
