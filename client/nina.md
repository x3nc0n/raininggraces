*Going into our 4th birth we weren’t planning on having a doula, but when my husband and I met Robin we both instantly felt we needed her to be apart of our birth team. Robin joined our team late in my pregnancy and was the perfect addition! She not only brought me encouragement, calmness, and confidence after a traumatic delivery with our 3rd, but she ended up being EXACTLY the person we needed when it came down to delivery time. I had an incredibly fast and furious birth and we weren’t able to notify our team in time to get everyone here, Robin (and her former cop driving skills) realized the urgency in my husbands’ phone call and got here with 10 minutes to spare and was the one that caught our daughter with no one else here to help! We then realized why we both felt that pull to add her to our team a few weeks prior I couldn’t recommend Robin more and she will always hold such a special place in our heart!*
