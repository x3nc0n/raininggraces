*My husband and I first worked with Robin through her Spinning Babies class. The information from that single class was incredibly helpful and gave us so much confidence as we prepared for the arrival of our first baby. Robin’s calm, sweet personality immediately put us at ease, and we felt an instant connection with her. After the class, we didn’t hesitate to book Robin as our doula.*
*As our doula, Robin has stayed in constant communication with us and always checks in to see how our ultrasounds and OB appointments have gone. When we found out our baby was breech at 33 weeks, Robin immediately jumped into action and helped us create a plan to encourage baby into the optimal position. After just two weeks of doing the exercises and daily activities she recommended, our baby is now head down!*
*My husband and I cannot recommend Robin and her services enough. She is a wealth of knowledge and is truly passionate about helping families safely and confidently welcome their babies into the world.*
