*Robin is truly an angel sent from heaven! Thankfully I had been thinking about doing an unmedicated birth for awhile, before I found out my severe preeclampsia would require me to forgo an epidural. It took my husband a bit of convincing to get on board with a doula, but after going through the process, he doesn’t regret a thing! Robin helped me make a birth plan and although I was too sick to do a lot of the positioning, she was very creative in helping me stay active, while allowing my body to rest at the same time. She was a great advocate for me when I was too out of it from the horrible mag I had to have for my BP. There’s no way I could have done through that without her support!*
